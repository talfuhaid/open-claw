# Outlook Setup Guide

Connect the Outlook skill to your Microsoft account.

Most teammates should use the **automated script** (`outlook-setup.sh`) —
it walks you through everything in ~3 minutes if the shared app registration
is already in the team vault. The manual steps below are for understanding
what the script does, or for Option B (your own app registration).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft account (Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live, or Microsoft 365)
- `jq` and `curl` installed (`sudo apt install jq curl`)
- For Option B only: Azure CLI (`az`) and access to
  [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

---

## Recommended: run the automated script

```bash
~/Projects/openclaw-team-workspace/main-agent/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-setup.sh
```

The script will:

1. **Detect existing credentials in `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`** and
   offer to reuse them (the "fast path"). If you have a working config
   from a prior setup, just say `Y` here and skip to the browser
   authorization step.
2. **Otherwise** prompt you to paste the shared `client_id` / `client_secret`
   from the team vault, or fall through to the full Azure-CLI-driven
   Option B flow (app registration, secret creation, permission setup).
3. **Save the config** to `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json` with the file
   backed up first if it already existed.
4. **Open the browser authorization flow** — paste back the localhost
   callback URL when the browser redirects.
5. **Verify three scopes** with per-scope probes (inbox, mailbox settings,
   people lookup) so failures point at exactly which consent didn't land.
6. **Register cron jobs** for the triage pipeline in the triage agent's
   workspace:
   - `check-and-trigger.sh` every minute
   - `outlook-seen.sh prune` daily at 3 AM

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run. It strips any existing matching
cron lines before re-registering, and backs up `config.json` /
`credentials.json` before overwriting.

If the script worked, you're done. The rest of this guide covers manual
setup for Option B, troubleshooting, and what each step does under the
hood.

## Manual: Option A (shared app registration)

The team maintains one Azure AD app registration (`Clawdbot-Outlook`) that
everyone authorizes against with their own mailbox. Tokens are per-user;
the app itself is shared.

- **`CLIENT_ID`:** `071a9762-cc36-4205-a7b6-4787f310c8c8`
- **`CLIENT_SECRET`:** retrieve from the team password vault
  (entry: `Clawdbot-Outlook`)

The `client_id` is not a secret — it's transmitted in plaintext on every
auth request and is safe to commit. The `client_secret` must stay in the
vault.

Skip to [Step 2](#step-2-save-configuration).

---

## Manual: Option B (your own app registration)

Follow this path if:

- Your tenant blocks multi-tenant apps
- You're forking this workspace for a different team
- You need blast-radius isolation from the shared app

### B.1 Register the app

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Search for **"App registrations"** → click it
3. Click **"+ New registration"**
4. Configure:
   - **Name:** `Clawdbot-Outlook` (or any name)
   - **Supported account types:** _Accounts in any organizational directory
     and personal Microsoft accounts_
   - **Redirect URI:** Platform = Web, URI = `http://localhost:54321`
5. Click **Register**

### B.2 Get client credentials

1. On the app overview page, copy the **Application (client) ID** →
   this is your `CLIENT_ID`
2. Go to **Certificates & secrets** in the left menu
3. Click **+ New client secret**
4. Add a description (e.g., `clawdbot`) and choose expiration (max 24 months)
5. Click **Add**
6. **Immediately copy the Value** (not the ID) → this is your `CLIENT_SECRET`
   - ⚠️ You can only see this once. Save it in your password manager right
     now — if you lose it, you have to generate a new one and every other
     user of the shared app has to rotate theirs too.

### B.3 Configure API permissions

1. Go to **API permissions** in the left menu
2. Click **+ Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**
4. Add these permissions:
   - `Mail.ReadWrite` — read and write mail
   - `Mail.Send` — send mail
   - `Calendars.ReadWrite` — read and write calendar
   - `MailboxSettings.Read` — read mailbox settings (required for cached
     timezone on token refresh)
   - `User.ReadBasic.All` — look up colleagues by name/email
     (required for people lookup; may need admin consent on work/school
     tenants)
   - `User.Read` — read your own profile
5. Click **Add permissions**

`offline_access` is requested at auth time, not configured here.

---

## Step 2: Save configuration

Create the config directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.outlook-mcp
```

Create `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "timezone": ""
}
```

The `timezone` field is populated automatically on first token refresh from
your mailbox settings. It uses Windows timezone format (e.g.,
`"India Standard Time"`), not IANA (`"Asia/Kolkata"`) — this is what
Microsoft Graph's `Prefer` header expects.

Lock down the file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.outlook-mcp/config.json
```

---

## Step 3: Authorize the app

Build the authorization URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`):

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:54321&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite%20https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send%20https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite%20https://graph.microsoft.com/MailboxSettings.Read%20https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadBasic.All%20offline_access&response_mode=query
```

1. Open the provided URL in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account (MFA may be required, especially from a new network location).
3. Grant the requested permissions.
4. Once you are redirected to the success page, click the "Copy Redirect URL" button.
5. Paste that copied URL back here in our chat.

---

## Step 4: Exchange code for tokens

```bash
CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
AUTH_CODE="the-code-from-step-3"

curl -s -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  --data-urlencode "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --data-urlencode "code=$AUTH_CODE" \
  --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=http://localhost:54321" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  --data-urlencode "scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/MailboxSettings.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadBasic.All offline_access" \
  > ~/.outlook-mcp/credentials.json

chmod 600 ~/.outlook-mcp/credentials.json
```

`--data-urlencode` (instead of one concatenated `-d` string) keeps the
`client_secret` off curl's visible command line — other processes on the
system can otherwise read it via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` while the request
is in flight.

The authorization code is single-use and expires in ~10 minutes. If this
step fails (e.g., invalid secret, network blip), you need to re-do Step 3
to get a fresh code — don't try to reuse the old one.

---

## Step 5: Verify setup

Three checks — each isolates a different scope so failures point at which
consent didn't land.

**Inbox access** (`Mail.ReadWrite`) — must succeed:

```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.access_token' ~/.outlook-mcp/credentials.json)

curl -s "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailFolders/inbox" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  | jq '{total: .totalItemCount, unread: .unreadItemCount}'
```

**Mailbox settings** (`MailboxSettings.Read`) — required for cached
timezone, soft failure:

```bash
curl -s "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailboxSettings/timeZone" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq
```

Expected: `{"value": "India Standard Time"}` or similar. A 403 here means
`MailboxSettings.Read` consent didn't land.

**People lookup** (`User.ReadBasic.All`) — soft failure:

```bash
curl -s "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?\$top=1&\$select=displayName,mail" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq
```

A 403 here usually means admin consent is required; the agent can still do
everything else — only person-by-name lookups break.

Once the first check passes, trigger a token refresh to populate the cached
timezone in `config.json`:

```bash
./scripts/outlook-token.sh refresh
```

Then confirm `config.json` shows a non-empty `timezone` field.

---

## Step 6: Register cron jobs (triage pipeline)

The triage agent uses cron, not OpenClaw's internal scheduler. Two jobs:

```
* * * * * ~/Projects/openclaw-team-workspace/outlook-traige-agent/skills/outlook/check-and-trigger.sh
0 3 * * * ~/Projects/openclaw-team-workspace/outlook-traige-agent/skills/outlook/outlook-seen.sh prune
```

To install them manually (the script does this automatically in
`setup_cron`):

```bash
TRIAGE_DIR="$HOME/Projects/openclaw-team-workspace/outlook-traige-agent/skills/outlook"

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "check-and-trigger\|outlook-seen.*prune"; \
 echo "* * * * * $TRIAGE_DIR/check-and-trigger.sh"; \
 echo "0 3 * * * $TRIAGE_DIR/outlook-seen.sh prune") | crontab -
```

Verify:

```bash
crontab -l
```

The triage scripts handle their own logging — `check-and-trigger.sh` writes
to `outlook-hook.log` at the triage workspace root. No redirect needed in
the cron line.

## Troubleshooting

**`AADSTS700016: Application not found`**
Double-check `client_id`. If using Option A, confirm you copied the full
UUID. If using Option B, ensure you selected _Accounts in any organizational
directory and personal Microsoft accounts_ during registration.

**`AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret`**
The secret was rotated on the app registration. For Option A, re-pull the
current secret from the team vault. For Option B, check Azure Portal →
app → Certificates & secrets and see if your secret is still listed and
non-expired. If not, create a new one (and notify teammates if it's a
shared app).

**`AADSTS7000218: ... body must contain client_assertion or client_secret`**
The `client_secret` param was empty or missing. Check `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`
actually has a non-empty `client_secret` field. If the setup script wrote
an empty secret, check its backup files (`config.json.bak.*`) for the
previous value.

**`AADSTS50076: multi-factor authentication required`**
Your tenant's conditional access policy is forcing re-MFA, typically
triggered by a new network location. Run `outlook-setup.sh` (or Step 3
manually) from the new location — the browser will prompt for MFA, and
the refreshed tokens will be bound to the new location.

**`AADSTS65001: User hasn't consented`**
Re-run Step 3. Make sure you click _Accept_ on the consent screen. If
scopes were recently added to the shared app, even already-authorized
users need to re-consent.

**`403 Forbidden` on `/me/mailboxSettings/timeZone`**
`MailboxSettings.Read` was not consented. Re-run the authorize URL — the
browser will re-prompt for the missing scope. Work/school accounts may
require admin consent.

**`403 Forbidden` on `/users`**
`User.ReadBasic.All` was not consented. Usually needs admin consent on
work/school tenants. Contact IT, or skip this scope if you don't need
people lookups.

**Token expired**
Access tokens last ~1 hour. Run `./scripts/outlook-token.sh refresh` to
get a new one. Refresh tokens last ~90 days with rolling renewal — as long
as you use the skill regularly, you won't need to re-authorize.

**Work/school account issues**
Your organization may require admin consent for some scopes (especially
`User.ReadBasic.All`). Contact your IT admin or use a personal Microsoft
account for testing.

**Timezone stuck as empty string in `config.json`**
The token refresh populates it. If it's still empty after running
`outlook-token.sh refresh`, check that `MailboxSettings.Read` passed
verification in Step 5 and that `outlook-token.sh` isn't silently
swallowing a 403.

**I lost my `client_secret` and can't find it in the vault**
Check shell history and session transcripts — if you ever ran
`az ad app credential reset` or pasted the secret into a script, it may
still be in `~/.bash_history` or an OpenClaw session JSONL. If genuinely
lost, generate a new secret in Azure Portal → app → Certificates &
secrets, then update the vault and notify teammates.

**Cron jobs missing after reboot or workspace switch**
Cron entries live in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/<user>` and survive reboots.
If they're gone, someone ran `crontab -e` and saved an empty buffer
(easy to do with `EDITOR=code` — VS Code returns before you save, so the
empty template gets installed). Re-run `outlook-setup.sh` or the manual
Step 6 block to re-register.
